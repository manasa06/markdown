#Italics and Bold:-
To make a phrase italic in Markdown, you can surround words with an underscore (_ ) or (*).
#####Example:
_Writing in Markdown is not that hard!_

*Writing in Markdown is not that hard!*

To make a phrase bold in Markdown, you can surround words with an underscore (__ ) or (**).

__Writing in Markdown is not that hard__

**Writing in Markdown is not that hard**

#Headers:-
To make headers in Markdown, you preface the phrase with a hash mark (#). You place the same number of hash marks as the size of the header you want. For example, for a header one, you'd use one hash mark (# Header One), while for a header three, you'd use three (### Header Three).
#####Example:
#header
##header
###header
####header
#####header
#Links:-
There are two different link types in Markdown, but both of them render the exact same way. The first link style is called an inline link. To create an inline link, you wrap the link text in brackets ( [ ] ), and then you wrap the link in parenthesis ( ( ) ). For example, to create a hyperlink to www.github.com, with a link text that says, Visit GitHub!, you'd write this in Markdown: [Visit GitHub!](www.github.com).
#####Example:
[click here to google.](www.google.com)
#Images:-
The difference between links and images is that images are prefaced with an exclamation point ( ! ).
#####Example:
For example, to create an inline image link to https://octodex.github.com/images/bannekat.png, with an alt text that says, Benjamin Bannekat, you'd write this in Markdown: ![Benjamin Bannekat](https://octodex.github.com/images/bannekat.png).
#Blockquotes:-
A blockquote is a sentence or paragraph that's been specially formatted to draw attention to the reader.
To create a block quote, all you have to do is preface a line with the "greater than" caret (>). 

#####Example:
>"In a few moments he was barefoot, his stockings folded in his pockets and his
  canvas shoes dangling by their knotted laces over his shoulders and, picking a
  pointed salt-eaten stick out of the jetsam among the rocks, he clambered down
  the slope of the breakwater."
#Lists:-
There are two types of lists in the known universe: unordered and ordered. That's a fancy way of saying that there are lists with bullet points, and lists with numbers.

To create an unordered list, you'll want to preface each item in the list with an asterisk ( * ).

* markdown
* git
* vue

An ordered list is prefaced with numbers, instead of asterisks.
